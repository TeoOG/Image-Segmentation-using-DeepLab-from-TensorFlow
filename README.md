# Image-Segmentation-using-DeepLab-from-TensorFlow
Image Segmentation with pretrained models . Created for Computer Vision course, to experiment with TensorFlow. We're utiling the DeepLab model:

https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab

The code performs semantic segmentation in a set of images. We also perform PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on the deep features of the set, in order to 
reduce the dimensionality of our data.
